# Enhanced Task Management System - Role-Based Assignment Features

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Task Assignment Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign`
- **Authorization**: Only senior officers (SP, DYSP, PI, Team Lead) can assign tasks
- **Features**:
  - Assign tasks to specific users
  - Set priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
  - Add due dates
  - Attach documents to task assignments

### 2. Frontend Role-Based UI
- **Assignment Button**: Only visible to authorized users (SP, DYSP, PI, Team Lead)
- **User Icon**: Indicates task assignment capability
- **Role Validation**: Frontend checks user role before showing assignment options

### 3. Document Attachment System
- **File Upload Simulation**: Add documents to task assignments
- **Attachment Management**: Add/remove attachments in assignment dialog
- **Document Categories**: Task attachments are categorized as 'task_attachment'
- **Storage Integration**: Documents are stored with proper metadata

### 4. Enhanced Security
- **Permission Validation**: Backend validates user roles before allowing assignments
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling for both local and Replit auth
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for unauthorized access

### 5. Activity Tracking
- **Assignment Logs**: All task assignments are logged in activity feed
- **Audit Trail**: Track who assigned what to whom with timestamps
- **Progress Monitoring**: Monitor assignment effectiveness

## Usage Examples

### For Senior Officers (SP, DYSP, PI, Team Lead):
1. Navigate to Task Management
2. Click the user icon on any task card
3. Fill assignment details:
   - Select assignee
   - Set priority
   - Add due date
   - Attach relevant documents
4. Submit assignment

### For Regular Members:
- Assignment button is hidden
- Can only edit their own assigned tasks
- Cannot create task assignments with attachments

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Authorization:
```javascript
// Role validation for task assignment
if (!['sp', 'dysp', 'pi', 'team_lead'].includes(userRole)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ 
    message: "Insufficient permissions to assign tasks" 
  });
}
```

### Frontend Role Check:
```javascript
// Conditional rendering based on user role
{user && ['sp', 'dysp', 'pi', 'team_lead'].includes(user.role || 'member') && (
  <Button onClick={() => openAssignmentDialog(task)}>
    <User className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Button>
)}
```

### Document Attachment:
```javascript
// Create document attachments
for (const attachment of attachments) {
  await storage.createDocument({
    title: attachment.title,
    description: `Task attachment: ${attachment.description}`,
    category: 'task_attachment',
    filePath: attachment.filePath,
    fileSize: attachment.fileSize,
    teamId: task.teamId,
    uploadedBy: userId,
    isPublic: false,
  });
}
```

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Task creation: SP, DYSP, PI, Team Lead only
   - Task assignment: Senior officers only
   - Document attachment: Authorized personnel only

2. **Session Validation**
   - Unified authentication handling
   - Proper session persistence
   - Cross-authentication method support

3. **Permission Hierarchy**
   - SP: Full access to all functions
   - DYSP: Deputy-level permissions
   - PI: Police Inspector permissions
   - Team Lead: Team-specific permissions
   - Member: Limited to assigned tasks

## Integration with Existing System

- **Dashboard Integration**: Assignment activities show in dashboard feed
- **Team Coordination**: Assignments align with team structures (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie)
- **Progress Tracking**: Assignments contribute to overall 150-day program progress
- **Document Management**: Attachments integrate with document management system
- **AI Assistant**: Task assignments can be discussed with AI for guidance

The enhanced task management system provides comprehensive role-based assignment capabilities while maintaining security and proper authorization throughout the SP Ahilyanagar administrative reform platform.
