AHILYANGAR WORKFLOW DEBUGGING CHECKPOINT
===========================================
Date: June 9, 2025
Status: TypeScript compilation errors identified and ready to fix

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
==========================

1. USER PROPERTY REFERENCE ERRORS (9 instances in routes.ts):
   - Line 437: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id
   - Line 620: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id  
   - Line 675: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id
   - Line 707: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id
   - Line 750: uploadedBy: req.user?.claims?.sub → uploadedBy: req.user?.id
   - Line 762: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id
   - Line 790: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id
   - Line 822: submittedBy: req.user?.claims?.sub → submittedBy: req.user?.id
   - Line 831: userId: req.user?.claims?.sub → userId: req.user?.id

2. DOCUMENT SCHEMA ERROR (1 instance in routes.ts):
   - Line 496: fileType: attachment.fileType → mimeType: attachment.fileType

3. FALLBACK PATTERNS (2 instances in routes.ts):
   - Line 882: const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
   - Line 894: const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub || req.user?.id;
   These should be: const userId = req.user?.id || req.user?.claims?.sub;

4. RBAC AUTHENTICATION ISSUES (3 instances in rbac.ts):
   - Line 120: const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub;
   - Line 178: const user = req.user?.dbUser || await storage.getUser(req.user?.claims?.sub);
   - Line 218: const userId = req.user?.claims?.sub;
   These need to be fixed to use req.user?.id

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
===================
The application was originally designed for Replit authentication where users have a 
`claims.sub` property, but the current User schema only has an `id` property. This 
mismatch is causing:
- 401 Unauthorized errors for admin endpoints
- Authentication middleware failures
- Frontend "users.map is not a function" errors
- WebSocket connection issues with undefined ports

SCHEMA ANALYSIS COMPLETED:
=========================
✓ User object structure: { id, username, email, firstName, lastName, role, ... }
✓ Documents table uses: mimeType (not fileType)
✓ User identification should use: req.user?.id (not req.user?.claims?.sub)

TESTING PLAN AFTER FIXES:
=========================
1. Fix all TypeScript compilation errors
2. Start the server (npm run dev)
3. Test SP role authentication to admin endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/local/login with SP credentials
   - GET /api/admin/users
   - GET /api/admin/audit-logs  
   - GET /api/admin/settings
4. Test WebSocket connection
5. Test chat API functionality
6. Test frontend admin console

CURRENT SERVER STATE:
====================
- Port: 5000 (changed from undefined)
- PERPLEXITY_API_KEY: Added to .env
- Authentication: Multi-auth setup with local + OTP + Google
- Database: SQLite with proper schema
- RBAC: Role-based access control configured

NEXT ACTIONS:
============
1. Fix all 9 req.user?.claims?.sub references in routes.ts
2. Fix 1 fileType reference in routes.ts  
3. Fix 3 req.user?.claims?.sub references in rbac.ts
4. Fix 2 fallback patterns in routes.ts
5. Test compilation with: tsc --noEmit
6. Start server and test authentication flow
7. Debug any remaining runtime issues

FILES TO MODIFY:
===============
- f:\New project\AhilyangarWorkflow\server\routes.ts (primary focus)
- f:\New project\AhilyangarWorkflow\server\rbac.ts (authentication middleware)

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
=================
✓ Node.js project with TypeScript
✓ Express server with session management
✓ SQLite database with Drizzle ORM
✓ Multi-authentication strategies
✓ Role-based access control system
✓ File upload handling with multer
✓ WebSocket support for real-time features

COMPLETION CRITERIA:
===================
✓ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
✓ Server starts without errors on port 5000
✓ SP role users can access admin endpoints without 401 errors
✓ Frontend admin console loads user data correctly
✓ WebSocket connections work without undefined URL errors
✓ Chat API responds without 500 errors

PRIORITY: HIGH - Authentication system is completely broken due to user property mismatch
